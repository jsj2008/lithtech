    IDS_MISSION_00_BRIEF    "UNITY has sent Cate Archer to Japan to investigate a rumored international crime convention expected to take place in the pastoral village of Inotakimura. Her objective is to photograph the meeting's participants without arousing their suspicion.\n\nHer first task will be to locate agent Isamu Hatori, who will provide further information on her assignment. He's waiting somewhere in the village."
    IDS_MISSION_01_BRIEF    "The meeting is scheduled to take place at the estate of an enigmatic figure known only as The Director. Cate will have to infiltrate the estate grounds, locate the main house, and find the window Hatori-san indicated on the map. This vantage should allow her to take the photographs she needs without exposing herself to unnecessary risk.\n\nOnce she's obtained the photos, she must return to the bridge where Yamata-san is waiting. A UNITY intercept team is standing by to evacuate her to Tokyo when the mission is complete."
    IDS_MISSION_02_BRIEF    "Spy plane photographs show a run-down, understaffed military base, but Mr. Barnes warns that this decrepitude is likely a ruse. Although the Americans often greatly overestimate Soviet military capacity, UNITY isn't taking any chances.\n\nThe first phase of Cate's mission is to facilitate her own escape. A little sabotage should go a long way toward preventing reinforcements from being called in.\n\nSanta has enlisted a pilot who is familiar with the region to get Cate in and out. She must protect him at all costs."
    IDS_MISSION_03_BRIEF    "After analyzing the Americans' intelligence data, UNITY is convinced that Project: Omega is headquartered in the Main Records Building at the center of the compound. Security will be tight, so it won't be easy for Cate to reach the target site, let alone get inside and recover the data she requires.\n\nFortunately, she's going in under the cover of night, which should afford some small advantage."
END

STRINGTABLE DISCARDABLE 
BEGIN
    IDS_MISSION_04_BRIEF    "Now that Cate has recovered information on Project: Omega, she faces the even greater challenge of getting it out of the Soviet Union. To complicate matters further, both the Russians and H.A.R.M. are hunting for her.\n\nShe'll have to cross her fingers and hope that her meticulous preparations pay off. The night is about to light up."
    IDS_MISSION_05_BRIEF    "Without any other compelling leads to follow, Cate heads to Akron, Ohio to search for clues at the former residence of the notorious Melvin Blitzny. Blitzny, a vacuum cleaner salesman by trade, had been groomed to assume the identity of UNITY operative Tom Goodman as part of H.A.R.M.'s last despicable plot. He met his end at the hands of his own mentor.\n\nWhatever trepidation Cate may feel at entering the domain of this treacherous man must be set aside if she is to achieve her goal."
    IDS_MISSION_06_BRIEF    "Magnus Armstrong has contacted his old friend Kamal, a disillusioned H.A.R.M. operative in India who promises his assistance. While Kamal isn't familiar with Project: Omega, he's certain any pertinent information can be found in the central vault at the Indian headquarters.\n\nBruno has concluded that a direct infiltration of the compound is too risky given the intense security Cate would likely face. Therefore, Kamal will help her accomplish perhaps her strangest objective thus far: to get a job with H.A.R.M. Once hired, she'll have the security clearance necessary to move about the compound freely."
    IDS_MISSION_07_BRIEF    "Having proven her value to H.A.R.M., Cate has secured a job with the very organization she has vowed to destroy. A higher security clearance should help her get close to the prize: the main vault. There she hopes to find the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nUnfortunately, the vault is off limits to all but the highest ranking H.A.R.M. employees, so the biggest challenge still lies ahead. If only she could have unearthed better intelligence about the security countermeasures she must face."
    IDS_MISSION_08_BRIEF    "The trail of clues has led Cate and Armstrong to a secret facility in Antarctica where H.A.R.M. is conducting Project: Omega. Once they discover its actual nature, they can plot a means of disrupting it.\n\nAssuming they don't strangle each other first."
    IDS_MISSION_09_BRIEF    "Because of Cate's success in India, The Director has ordered the destruction of H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters as punishment. The attack will provide an ideal field test for the super soldiers before they are sent to Khios on their primary mission.\n\nAlthough Cate has recovered vital information on Project: Omega, she has decided to proceed directly to India in hopes of averting the tragedy that is likely to unfold once the assault begins."
    IDS_MISSION_10_BRIEF    "With the technical specifications she recovered from the Antarctic facility, Cate feels confident that Doctor Schenker can come up with a means of combating the super soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, the news that Armstrong is alive and in the custody of H.A.R.M. has given her a clear sense of purpose. She must find out where he is and devise a plan to rescue him.\n"
    IDS_MISSION_11_BRIEF    "Cate has snuck aboard H.A.R.M.'s top secret underwater base in an effort to rescue Magnus Armstrong from certain death. Her first task will be to locate him. Information on his whereabouts should be stored in the supercomputer.\n\nOnce Armstrong is free, the two of them will have to improvise an escape route, as Cate's shark mini-sub only seats one."
    IDS_MISSION_12_BRIEF    "With the underwater base collapsing around them and a rogue super soldier on the loose, Cate and Armstrong must work together to escape from this watery grave.\n\nAssuming they can even find a way off the base, they'll still have to contend with well armed and equally desperate H.A.R.M. personnel fighting for their own lives."
    IDS_MISSION_13_BRIEF    "After falling into the hands of H.A.R.M., Cate finds herself in a needlessly elaborate but nonetheless perilous death trap. She'll need quick reflexes and extraordinary judgment to emerge unscathed.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in the Sea of Marmara is getting bleaker by the hour. If she's going to derail H.A.R.M.'s nefarious machinations, she'd better do it quickly.\n"
    IDS_MISSION_14_BRIEF    "The world teeters on the brink of nuclear catastrophe, with the United States and Soviet Union closer to war than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Again, the fate of humanity hinges upon the sovereignty of a tiny island nation. \n\nH.A.R.M.'s super soldiers are en route to Khios aboard an undetectable submarine designed to bypass the inevitable NATO blockade. The Americans can't send in troops to defend the island without provoking the Soviets, and yet the Soviets are claiming they are powerless to stop the invasion. Both sides are locked in a deadly standoff, but it is H.A.R.M.'s finger on the trigger."
    IDS_MISSION_15_BRIEF    "Cate has snuck aboard H.A.R.M.'s top secret underwater base for reasons we don't want to disclose in this demo for fear of spoiling surprises should you decide to play the game. Suffice to say she has a mission to accomplish and the portion of it you are about to sample is merely the introduction."
    IDS_MISSION_TEMP_BRIEF  "A routine mission has gone disastrously awry and now Cate Archer is in serious trouble. She's probably halfway to the rendezvous point by now with ninjas swarming after her.\n\nThe UNITY intercept team that was to evacuate her to Tokyo must now rush to her aid. The objective is simple: get Cate out of there in one piece.\n"
    IDS_MISSION_TEMP_BRIEF2 "Cate has managed to escape from a remote Soviet military base with crucial information on Project: Omega. She obtained this data from a super computer that appears to have been supplied and monitored by H.A.R.M.\n\nA UNITY intercept team has been sent in to mop up. The team's primary objective is to put that computer out of commission once and for all.\n\nThe team is being airdropped inside the base perimeter and will rally at a small hunting cabin near the compound itself.\n"
    IDS_MISSION_TEMP_BRIEF3 "Cate is currently en route to Calcutta, where she will attempt to infiltrate H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters to learn more about Project: Omega.\n\nA UNITY intercept team is already on site to gather intelligence to facilitate her mission. They will need to locate and photograph a known H.A.R.M. employee by the name of Balaji Malpani.\n"
    IDS_MISSION_TEMP_BRIEF4 "Cate has radioed in with disturbing news. Magnus Armstrong is trapped in Antarctica with H.A.R.M. reinforcements closing in and some sort of indestructible super soldier on the loose.\n\nA UNITY intercept team is being sent in to rescue Armstrong and demolish the site to prevent further work on Project: Omega.\n"

Group A (based in Siberia) was allotted 18 cigarettes and 9 cups of coffee per day. Control Group B (based in Finland) abstained. Over a period of 26 months, Group A was found to sleep 42 percent less on average. While the mortality rate due to on-the-job accidents for Group A was 87 percent higher, we conclude high worker turnover will mitigate decreases in productivity due to aging."
